Game of choice: tic tac toe (maybe too simple)

Must stick to similar to derek style (with the files etc.)
Must have a clean coding style
Must be able to REFACTOR maybe a function at one point (this must be recorded in a commit or whatever)
Must have adapter design pattern used
Must use a stub
Must use a mock
Must use a fake
Must use unit tests and have a good coverage
Must have a usable game

Classes:
player
computer
main games logic
main (just for calling stuff and actually running the program)
adapter design stuff

ideas: maybe if too simple can make a login system or at the very least
being able to name the player
