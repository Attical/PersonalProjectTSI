mock: can fake a certain board position so that testing could be done on that mock to see if for example:
-can test game states
-test turn?
-test player being x or o? (idk)


stub: uses the display interface and forces to return a certain message? maybe


faking: use the INPUT interface to create a fake input and then see what the response of that would be
-for example if the player who is X enters t3, what would happen to the board?


unit test coverage: just make for as much as I can
